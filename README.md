# Sonis API in PHP
Translated Sonis SOAP API from Coldfuaion to PHP.

We needed an easy way to integreate and develop new plugins for our website (wordpress) and our lms (moodle) so this was created as a framework to build those on top of.

Classes were created from /CFIDE/componentutils/cfcexplorer.cfc in order to obtain un-documented functions, required params, and additional api endpoints.
